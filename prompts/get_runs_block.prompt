You are a specialized YAML to JSON parser. Your ONLY job is to find the 'runs' block in the provided text, parse its YAML structure, and return it as a nested JSON object.

The output JSON object you create MUST contain a single top-level key: "runs".

---
### EXAMPLE
This is how you should convert the YAML.

#### Example Input YAML:
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: "Install Dependencies"
      run: npm install
      shell: bash

#### Corresponding JSON Output:
{
  "runs": {
    "using": "composite",
    "steps": [
      {
        "name": "Install Dependencies",
        "run": "npm install",
        "shell": "bash"
      }
    ]
  }
}

Now, perform this conversion on the following document content.
If no 'runs' block is found in the content, you MUST return an empty JSON object: {}.

### Document Content:
{{{{document_content}}}}

### Your JSON Output:
